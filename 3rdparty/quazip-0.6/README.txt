QuaZIP is the C++ wrapper for Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
(AKA minizip) using Trolltech's Qt library.

It uses existing ZIP/UNZIP package C code and therefore depends on
the zlib library.

Also, it depends on Qt 4.

To compile it on UNIX dialect:

$ cd quazip
$ qmake
$ make

You must make sure that:
* You have Qt 4 properly and fully installed (including tools and
  headers, not just library)
* "qmake" command runs Qt 4's qmake, not some other version (you'll have
  to type full path to qmake otherwise).

To install compiled shared library, just type:

$ make install

By default, it installs in /usr/local, but you may change it using

$ qmake PREFIX=/wherever/you/want/to/install

You do not have to compile and install QuaZIP to use it. You can just
(and sometimes it may be the best way) add QuaZIP's source files to your
project and use them.

See doc/html or, if you do not have a browser, quazip/*.h and
quazip/doc/* files for the more detailed documentation.

For Windows, it's essentially the same, but you may have to adjust
settings for different environments.

If you want to include QuaZIP sources directly in your project or if
you want to use QuaZIP compiled as a static library using
"qmake CONFIG+=statliclib", you have to define the QUAZIP_STATIC macro,
otherwise you're likely to run into problems as QuaZIP symbols will be
marked as dllimported.
